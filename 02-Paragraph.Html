<P>We all have financial commitments, which means we can’t always do as much as we’d like to help other people. So a gift in your Will, of as little as one percent of your estate, is an opportunity to give more than you might ever have been able to give in your lifetime, providing comfort, care and compassion for people long into the future.</P>
<P>Your Will tells the people you leave behind about the person you are. It also helps pass on your principles and the values that matter to you.</P>
